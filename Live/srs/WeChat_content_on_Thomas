srs_ipv6 v1.0
--------------------------------------
git clone https://github.com/dreibh/srs.git
cd srs
git remote add upstream https://github.com/wenjiegit/srs
git fetch --all
git checkout ipv6

Note:
"git checkout ipv6" will give you the IPv6 branch with my changes. All other branches are unmodified, i.e. without changing to the "ipv6" branch, you will not see the updates.
Build and run as usual. You just have to use IPv6 addresses, of course. IPv4 works as well.

srs_ipv6 v2.0
--------------------------------------
I just noticed that the repository wenjie/srs is actually a fork of the upstream repository ossrs/srs. The development is going on in this repository (see https://github.com/ossrs/srs). 
So, I created another branch "ossrs2.0-ipv6" which is based on this upstream project's sources instead. To change to this branch:

git fetch --all
git checkout ossrs2.0-ipv6
cd trunk
./configure
make

(The upstream repository ossrs/srs receives all updates, while the fork wenjie/srs has not been updated for some time. This may be relevant if you discover bugs.)

srs_ipv6 v3.0
--------------------------------------
I had a further look into the SRS sources. 
Since there is a release 3.0 now, I adapted the IPv6 code for release 3.0. 
It is located in the new branch "ossrs3.0-ipv6". 
I also found some small issues in the release 2.0 IPv6 branch and fixed them as well.

To update:
git fetch --all
git checkout ossrs3.0-ipv6
cd trunk
./configure
make

A wrote a small script to identify socket API function calls: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEAT-project/neat/dreibh/neat-socketapi/socketapi/find-socket-functions
"./find-socket-functions ~/src/srs/trunk/src/" find 67 places in the SRS sources.
Adapting it to NEAT should not be very difficult.
