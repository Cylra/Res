Configuring IP rules and corresponding routing tables is simple.

Once you add a new interface INTERFACE, with address ADDRESS in network NETWORK (just set in your addresses):

Example:
INTERFACE=eth0
NETWORK=3ffe:dead:beef:ffff::/64
ADDRESS=3ffe:dead:beef:ffff::2a
ROUTER= 3ffe:dead:beef:ffff::1

For each interface, choose a different routing table number TABLE, e.g. 1 or 2. The value does not matter, it must just be unique. Use e.g. 1 for interface #1, 2 for interface #2, etc.

E.g. TABLE=2

Then, all you need is:
ip -6 route add NETWORK scope link dev INTERFACE table TABLE
ip -6 route add default via ROUTER dev INTERFACE table TABLE
ip -6 rule add from ADDRESS table TABLE

When removing addresses, just use "remove" instead of "add":
ip -6 rule remove from ADDRESS table TABLE
ip -6 route remove default via ROUTER dev INTERFACE table TABLE
ip -6 route remove NETWORK scope link dev INTERFACE table TABLE

Check your configuration with:
ip -6 rule show
ip -6 route show table TABLE

======

Before you proceed with anything related to MPTCP:
ping6 -I SOURCE DESTINATION
(set addresses for source and destination -- SOURCE and DESTINATION -- according to your configuration)

Make sure that reach combination, which will correspond to a possible MPTCP subflow, works before proceeding. If Ping6 does not work, MPTCP will also not work.

In Ubuntu, you can set addresses in /etc/network/interfaces. If you use this, you can specify post-up and pre-down rules, just setting/removing the configuration above, e.g.:

iface eth1 inet6 static
    address ADDRESS
    network NETWORK
    gateway GATEWAY
    post-up /sbin/ip -6 route add NETWORK scope link dev INTERFACE table TABLE && /sbin/ip -6 route add default via ROUTER dev INTERFACE table TABLE && /sbin/ip -6 rule add from ADDRESS table TABLE
    pre-down /sbin/ip -6 rule remove from ADDRESS table TABLE && /sbin/ip -6 route remove default via ROUTER dev INTERFACE table TABLE && /sbin/ip -6 route remove NETWORK scope link dev INTERFACE table TABLE

Again, test the settings thoroughly (ip -6 rule show, ip -6 route show table TABLE) before proceeding!
