Hi,Thomas,for deploying srs,I need three operating systems with 
a graphical interface and direct access, 
and I need permission to install the software. 
These machines are available to me, for example,
kongsbakken.uit.nornet,eina.hig.nornet and wanqun.hu.nornet.Thanks！

--------------------------------------
Thomas
For the SRS experiments, you will get access to the following custom VMs:
meilan.hu.nornet
dingo.simula.nornet
wombat.uia.nornet
koala.ntnu.nornet
wallaby.uib.nornet
redback.hin.nornet

On these VMs, you have full root access. That is, you can install an MPTCP kernel, etc..

You can also use X11 in all VMs with "ssh -CX ...". 
That is, you can use remote GUI programs. 
However, X11 is latency-sensitive in addition to the need for sufficient bandwidth. 
Trying to use GUI programs from Haikou on a VM in Europe will be very inconvenient.

You can however directly connect an own PC to the NorNet Core switch in Haikou. 
There, you can normally use all GUI programs, 
e.g. a video client displaying streamed data from remote NorNet Core machines.

Hi,Thomas,for deploying web test platform（use java server pages）,
I need java environment on gatekeeper.can i install it?

--------------------------------------
Thomas
The gatekeeper is just for access and temporary data storage of the NorNet Core users.
You can use the machine dingo.simula.nornet for the experiment. There, you can install Java, etc..

--------------------------------------
龙宇
Can i access dingo.simula.nornet directly from my pc?

--------------------------------------
Thomas
The 6 VMs are now ready. User name is "handover". Xing Zhou can give you the password.

The password for the handover experiment VMs is "hoHU@NnTb!" (without quotes).

The VMs are directly accessible inside NorNet Core only, for security reasons. 
But it should be easily possible to patch an Ethernet port from the lab to the server room, 
to get direct Ethernet connection to the NorNet Core switch. 
When you are connected to the switch, 
you have direct access to all NorNet Core systems at all sites.

You can probably ask Fu Fa for such a connection.

--------------------------------------
龙宇
you mean, kuang and i use the internet cable to connect 
pc and the server room on the first floor.so we can direct access all sites.

--------------------------------------
Thomas
Yes. Connect your PCs to this switch. Then, you can use IP addresses inside NorNet Core. 
Then, you have direct IPv4 and IPv6 access to all other NorNet Core sites.

So, you could set up SRS systems at different other NorNet Core sites, and stream to your PCs.

There is an RADVD service running on the tunnelbox. 
That is, once you connect a PC to the switch, 
you automatically receive IPv6 addresses for both, CERNET and China Unicom. 
For IPv4, you get a CERNET IPv4 address by DHCP. 
DHCP does not support multiple IPv4 addresses. 
You can however make a static configuration.

Hi，Thomas.The 6 VM you give are only one ISP has ipv6, 
the interface of docker0 does not have ipv6 address.is it?

I saw in the /etc/network/interfaces that a network card eth0 is configured. 
Others are not configured?

--------------------------------------
Thomas
See the eth0 interface. This is the external one.

eth0 has as many IP addresses as there are ISPs. 
If there are 4 ISPs, there are 4 IPv4 and 4 IPv6 addresses.

Note, use "ip" for viewing the addresses. "ifconfig" only shows one IPv4 address.

ip -4 addr show dev eth0

Multi-homing is handled by the tunnelbox. 
It already has the IP routing rules configured. 
So, no need to set up routing rules in NorNet Core VMs.
